# SwapVM Programs Catalog

This document catalogs different kinds of SwapVM programs, their typical instruction composition, and expected behavior.

---

> **Important Notice:** 1inch production integrations (including AggregationRouter flows) will use only a strict, predefined subset of SwapVM programs with tightly bounded parameter ranges and completed security reviews. Risk from interacting with arbitrary or maliciously crafted SwapVM programs remains with the taker/resolver choosing to execute them.

In line with the notice above, follow these recommendations when building SwapVM programs:

- Provide analytical proof (or strong formal/empirical evidence) of model stability; public notes or papers are encouraged.
- Constrain dangerous parameter ranges in instruction builders to prevent unsafe program construction.
- Provide a thorough composition guide when your design supports multiple instruction-order variants.

## Purpose of this document

- Provide a reference for program patterns used in SwapVM.
- Describe when to use each program type.
- Document instruction sequences and ordering constraints.
- Capture security notes and invariant expectations per program type.

## SwapVM Program Key Points

When designing a SwapVM program, we focus on these security-critical technical points:

- **Balance mode and use case:**
  - **Static balances (`StaticBalances`)**: fixed-rate, stateless execution; typically used for 1D strategies (limit orders, auctions, RFQ-like flows).
  - **Dynamic balances (`DynamicBalances`)**: stateful reserves updated across swaps; typically used for 2D AMM strategies.
  - **Aqua-backed mode (`useAquaInsteadOfSignature = true`)**: balances are sourced/settled via Aqua instead of signature-based local state.
- **Instruction ordering is security-critical:**
  - Reordering instructions can change pricing, settlement amounts, invalidation behavior, and external side effects.
  - Fee instruction placement is especially sensitive and can alter economic outcomes.
- **Invariant requirements must hold for the full composed program:**
  - Symmetry, additivity profile, monotonicity, quote/swap consistency, balance sufficiency, and strategy liveness.
  - Validate invariants with scenario tests before production deployment.

**Thorough testing and audit are mandatory for every program before production use.**  

You can use these invariant suites as references for testing your programs:

- **1D strategy reference tests:** [`test/invariants/DutchAuctionLimitSwapInvariants.t.sol`](../test/invariants/DutchAuctionLimitSwapInvariants.t.sol)
- **2D strategy reference tests:** [`test/invariants/ConcentrateXYCInvariants.t.sol`](../test/invariants/ConcentrateXYCInvariants.t.sol)

## Catalog

### 1) Limit Order Programs (1D, static balances)

- **Intent:** Fixed-rate one-direction swaps with optional partial fills.
- **Required Core:**
  - `StaticBalances`
  - `LimitSwap` or `LimitSwapFullAmount`
- **Common Add-ons:**
  - `InvalidateBit`
  - `InvalidateTokenIn` / `InvalidateTokenOut`
  - `DutchAuctionBalanceIn` / `DutchAuctionBalanceOut`
  - `BaseFeeAdjuster`
  - `RequireMinRate` / `AdjustMinRate`
  - `TWAPSwap`

**Example A - One-time limit order (bitmap invalidator):**

Use case: one-shot maker quote that must execute at most once.  
Analog: RFQ/limit-order style flow (not a pool AMM).  
Difference note: SwapVM composes this behavior via instruction ordering and invalidators, so execution/fee behavior can differ from traditional order protocols.

```solidity
bytes memory bytecode = bytes.concat(
    InvalidateBit.build(123), // One-time replay protection
    StaticBalances.build(1000e18, 2000e18), // Set fixed-rate balances for 1D swap
    LimitSwap.build(tokenA, tokenB) // Compute limit-order amounts
);
```

**Example B - Partial-fill limit order (token-out invalidator):**

Use case: fixed-rate quote that can be filled over multiple swaps until exhausted.  
Analog: partially fillable limit-order systems.  
Difference note: partial-fill accounting is instruction-driven (`InvalidateTokenOut`) and can differ from external orderbook accounting models.

```solidity
bytes memory bytecode = bytes.concat(
    StaticBalances.build(1000e18, 2000e18), // Set fixed-rate balances for 1D swap
    LimitSwap.build(tokenA, tokenB), // Compute limit-order amounts
    InvalidateTokenOut.build() // Track cumulative output for partial fills
);
```

**Invariant Focus (Limit Order Programs):**
- Quote/swap consistency under exact-in and exact-out flows.
- Threshold and min-rate correctness for protected fills.
- Invalidation correctness (no replay, no overfill, deterministic partial-fill accounting).
- Balance sufficiency and rounding behavior near small/dust amounts.

### 2) AMM Programs (2D, dynamic balances)

- **Intent:** Stateful bidirectional liquidity strategies.
- **Required Core:**
  - Dynamic balance initialization (`DynamicBalances`)
  - One primary AMM primitive:
    - `XYCSwap`
    - `XYCConcentrateSwap`
    - `PeggedSwap`
- **Common Add-ons:**
  - Fee instructions (`FeeFlatIn` / `FeeFlatOut`, `FeeProtocol` for third-party fees with static receivers and/or dynamic providers)
  - `Decay`
  - `TWAPSwap`
  - Control flow instructions (`Jump`, `JumpIfDirection`, `JumpIfTokenIn`, `JumpIfTokenOut`, `Deadline`, `Salt`, ...)
- **Ordering Note:** Fee instruction placement is security-critical and changes pricing/settlement behavior.

**Example A - XYCSwap AMM:**

Use case: generic constant-product AMM curve for volatile pairs.  
Analog: Uniswap V2-style `x*y=k` pool.  
Difference note: SwapVM uses composable VM instructions, so fee layering and exact internal math may differ from canonical Uniswap V2 implementations.

```solidity
bytes memory bytecode = bytes.concat(
    DynamicBalances.build(1_000e18, 1_000e18), // Initialize AMM reserves in dynamic storage
    XYCSwap.build() // Apply x*y=k swap pricing
);
```

**Example B - Concentrated liquidity swap (2D, price-bounded):**

Use case: liquidity concentrated into a bounded price range for capital efficiency.  
Analog: Uniswap V3-style concentrated liquidity behavior.  
Difference note: price-range logic and fee composition are implemented through SwapVM instructions and can differ from Uniswap V3 internals/math details.

```solidity
bytes memory bytecode = bytes.concat(
    DynamicBalances.build(1_000e18, 1_000e18), // Initialize AMM reserves in dynamic storage
    XYCConcentrateSwap.build(sqrtPriceMin, sqrtPriceMax) // Concentrated x*y=k swap within price bounds
);
```

**Example C - PeggedSwap AMM (pegged assets):**

Use case: low-slippage swapping for correlated/pegged assets.  
Analog: Curve StableSwap-style behavior.  
Difference note: SwapVM pegged math and fee integration are not byte-for-byte Curve StableSwap and may produce different edge-case behavior.

```solidity
bytes memory bytecode = bytes.concat(
    DynamicBalances.build(1_000e18, 1_000e18), // Initialize AMM reserves in dynamic storage
    PeggedSwap.build(1_000e18, 1_000e18, 100e27, 1, 1) // Pegged-curve swap: x0, y0, A = 100 (tight stablecoin pair), rateA, rateB
);
```

**Example D - Decay-enhanced AMM:**

Use case: AMM with virtual-balance decay for MEV/frontrun resistance.  
Analog: Mooniswap-style virtual balances/decay behavior.  
Difference note: decay is composed as a dedicated instruction with SwapVM-specific interaction with fees and swap primitives.

```solidity
bytes memory bytecode = bytes.concat(
    DynamicBalances.build(1_000e18, 1_000e18), // Initialize AMM reserves in dynamic storage
    Decay.build(300), // Apply virtual-balance decay offset
    XYCSwap.build() // Execute swap with decay-adjusted state
);
```

**Invariant Focus (AMM Programs):**
- Exact in/out symmetry across representative trade sizes.
- Additivity profile (strict/additive/subadditive target depending on strategy design).
- Monotonicity (larger trades should not get better effective price unless explicitly intended).
- Strategy liveness when one side is depleted (reverse swaps should restore operability where applicable).
- Fee-placement correctness and quote/swap consistency with composed fee instructions.

### 3) Aqua-backed Programs

- **Intent:** Use Aqua as balance source/settlement layer with the same VM logic.
- **Setup Trait:** `useAquaInsteadOfSignature = true`
- **Maker Liquidity Model:** Funds can be used on demand from Aqua balances, so makers do not need to lock isolated liquidity per strategy.
- **Multi-Strategy Usage:** The same Aqua-backed liquidity can be reused across multiple different strategies at the same time.
- **Differences vs non-Aqua:**
  - Authorization and balance source differ (Aqua balance mode vs signature mode).
  - `useAquaInsteadOfSignature` changes settlement/auth flow, not VM strategy composition itself.
  - Core AMM or limit instruction logic can remain the same.
- **Important:** SwapVM strategy composition works both with Aqua-backed settlement and without Aqua (signature-based mode).


### 4) SwapVM Programs with Conditional Flow

- **Intent:** Add runtime branching (gating, route selection, or dynamic control flow) based on swap context or external logic.
- **Key Risk:** Branching can introduce hidden execution paths that are hard to reason about and easy to misconfigure.

**Example A - Permissioned swap by taker balance (institutional gate):**

Use case: allow execution only for takers that hold a required token/NFT balance.

```solidity
bytes memory bytecode = bytes.concat(
    // Gate: taker must hold gateToken (or NFT) balance > 0
    OnlyTakerTokenBalanceNonZero.build(gateToken), // Restrict execution to eligible takers
    // Regular limit-order path
    StaticBalances.build(1_000e18, 2_000e18), // Set fixed-rate balances for 1D swap
    LimitSwap.build(tokenIn, tokenOut) // Compute limit-order amounts
);
```

**Example B - Best strategy selection (XYC vs Pegged):**

Use case: evaluate multiple AMM strategy branches and execute the one that gives better output for current conditions.  
Reference: `test/RunLoop.t.sol` (`test_BestRouteSelector_XYC_vs_Pegged`).

```solidity
bytes memory strategy1 = XYCSwap.build(); // Branch A: x*y=k swap
bytes memory strategy2 = PeggedSwap.build(50e18, 50e18, 100e27, 1, 1); // Branch B: pegged-curve swap

bytes memory selectorArgs = abi.encodePacked(
    uint8(2),                         // Number of branches
    uint16(strategy1.length), strategy1,
    uint16(strategy2.length), strategy2
); // Packed branch bytecodes

bytes memory bytecode = bytes.concat(
    DynamicBalances.build(100e18, 100e18), // Initialize shared reserves
    Extruction.build(address(bestRouteSelectorTarget), selectorArgs) // Delegate to selector and run best branch
);
```

Complex scenarios with conditional jumps/branching (and, especially, containing ```_extruction```) should be tested very carefully; they can contain hidden logical flaws and unsafe edge paths.

**Invariant Focus (Conditional-Flow Programs):**
- Branch determinism and quote/swap path consistency (same inputs -> same branch).
- Jump-target correctness (no invalid offsets, no accidental instruction skipping/corruption).
- Authorization/gating correctness (restricted users fail, authorized users pass as intended).
- Economic safety across all branches (no branch yields unintended favorable pricing or bypasses checks).
- Termination/liveness: no hidden loops or dead-end paths that break execution.
